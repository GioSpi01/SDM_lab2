### **Ontology Creation and Population**

* **`12_B.1_SpissoYao.ipynb` / `12_B.1_SpissoYao.py`**
  Generates the TBox schema based on the classes and properties described in the report. The output is saved as `12_B.1_SpissoYao.tbox.ttl`.

* **`12_B.2_SpissoYao.ipynb` / `12_B.2_SpissoYao.py`**
  Generates the ABox instances according to the defined TBox schema. The instances are created from `research_papers.csv` and stored as `12_B.2_SpissoYao_abox.ttl`.

---

### **Knowledge Graph Embedding and Querying**

* **`12_C.2_SpissoYao.ipynb` / `12_C.2_SpissoYao.py`**
  Demonstrates an example using the TransE model on the `C.2_query.tsv` dataset (used in the most basic model subsection). It generates embeddings for entities, computes a resulting embedding using a defined formula, and displays the closest matching entity along with its embedding matrix.

---

### **Model Training and Evaluation**

* **`12_C.3_Training_SpissoYao.ipynb` / `12_C.3_Training_SpissoYao.py`**
  Trains several PyKEEN models (TransH, RotatE, ComplEx, ConvKB) using the `C.1_query.tsv` dataset. Performs hyperparameter tuning and saves results as:

  * `transh_hpo_results`
  * `rotate_hpo_results`
  * `complex_hpo_results`
  * `convkb_hpo_results`

* **`12_C.3_Evaluation_SpissoYao.ipynb` / `12_C.3_Evaluation_SpissoYao.py`**
  Loads the stored tuning results to identify the best configuration for each model. Compares the top-performing models and selects the best overall model based on validation performance. This selected model is then evaluated on the test set.

---

### **Classifier Using Learned Embeddings**

* **`12_C.4_SpissoYao.ipynb` / `12_C.4_SpissoYao.py`**
  Implements a classifier using the embeddings generated by the best-performing model (selected in the evaluation phase). Evaluates the classifier performance on a downstream classification task.

### **Report**

* **`12_SpissoYao.pdf`**
  The full lab report summarizing the theoretical background, methodology, implementation, and results of the lab work.
